# BlueJam
this is a roguelike deckbuilder inspired mainly by fights in tight spaces, nitro kid, dawncaster, trials of fire, and final fantasy tactics.
the player navigates a procedurally generated overworld while battling enemies on tactics-style battlefields.
enemies play by the same rules as the player, and the player builds a deck from cards used by defeated enemies.
